/*
1. Syntax: Declared by specifying the type, name, and size in brackets,
e.g., int arr[10];.
2. Fixed Size: Size must be known at compile time or be a constant expression.
3. Zero-Based Indexing: Arrays are indexed starting from 0.
4. Storage: Contiguous block of memory.
5. Type Uniformity: All elements must be of the same type.
*/

/*
Index is always start from zero.
(Array length = Arrays Last Index + 1);

1.Use Indexes: Access with arr[index].
2.Starts at 0: First element is arr[0].
3.For Loops: Iterate with loops.
4.No Bounds Check: Accessing outside the array size is unsafe.

// Call by reference

/*

1. Direct Access: Call by reference passes the address of variables, 
allowing functions to modify the actual values.
2. Pointers in C: Implemented using pointers that point to the original data.
3.  Efficiency: Avoids copying large data structures, saving memory and time.
4. Multiple Returns: Can return multiple values from a function via out-parameters.
5. Risk: Increases the potential for unintended side effects if not used carefully.

 Declares a function that takes two pointers to int (i.e., addresses of integers) as parameters.
This allows the function to modify the original integer variables by accessing their memory addresses.

It says: "swap is a function that takes two int pointers and returns nothing (void)".
